OKC Super Calendar — Nightly Event Agent (React Version)

Runs via GitHub Actions every night at 2 AM Central (8 AM UTC).

Data flow:
  1. Reads current events & happy hours from Google Sheets (source of truth)
  2. Calls Anthropic API with web search for each source to find new events
  3. Deduplicates new events against what's already in the sheet
  4. Writes new events back to the Google Sheet "Events" tab
  5. Exports full Events + Happy Hours tabs as JSON files
  6. Commits JSON files to the React repo → triggers Vercel rebuild

Supports dual-category tagging (cat + cat2) for crossover events.
